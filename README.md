# Identicon

This project is part of Stephen Grider's course on Elixir and Phoenix, which I am currently taking and coding along. I have created a repo for it, solely for the purpose of my own learning as I approach a new programming language. I do not present this as my own work, though I may modify it as I gain comfort in working with Elixir.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `identicon` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:identicon, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/identicon](https://hexdocs.pm/identicon).
